Fixed: 
Game seems to skip ahead several years right at the start.
After evoking a disaster, evoking the same disaster while the sound is not playing will not play or repeat its sound.
Leveling up seems very slow for some reason.
Level up bar now moved to right side of screen. 
GUI changed to accomodate new level up bar
Red balloon procedural text generation still needs to be finished.
Hovering over an advisor will cause the border around one of the disasters to be drawn slightly thicker.

To Do:
After playing for a while and handling all of the balloons, only green balloons were appearing.
Clicking all of the green balloons available quickly makes the damage you take 0.
Their are two different systems for increasing production over time. I have disabled mine for the time being.
Game moves too fast to read balloons without pausing. We may want to reduce game speed.
Many areas of code have inconsistent indentation or could use additional commenting.
